# The Brief

This is a conceptual project. I took a look at websites like FakeClients and Good Brief to try and find conceptual cover design projects but I unfortunately couldn’t find any free options. So, I just took the format those websites usually put the briefs in and asked AI to make me one. The brief for this project is as follows:

<div class="border border-[var(--border-gray)] bg-[var(--nav-gray)] p-8 rounded-lg my-8 text-[var(--inactive-gray)]" id="shadow" >
**Book Title**: "Moments Between Us"

**Author Name**: S. L. Taylor

**Book Description**: In the heart of a quaint Victorian town, "Moments Between Us" unfolds against the backdrop of close-knit community bonds. Lady Evelyn Sinclair, tethered to the expectations of her small-town upbringing, finds her soul yearning for liberation from the ordinary. Lord Alexander Harrington, a mysterious newcomer whose arrival ignites whispers and curiosity among the townsfolk. Amidst the cobblestone streets and cozy cottages, their complicated romance challenges the fabric of tradition, as they navigate the intricacies of love in a place where every secret is a shared tale.

**Brief**: Design a captivating cover that evokes the charm of a Victorian small town, showcasing the complicated relationship of Lady Evelyn and Lord amidst quaint cottages and streets, capturing the essence of forbidden love within the close-knit community of 'Moments Between Us' by S.L. Taylor.

## The Process for The Final Cover

The first thing that popped into my head was to check out a bunch of paintings from the Victorian Era. I struggled to find one that really fit the themes of the book at first, but eventually, I stumbled upon **"The Young Man at the Window” by Gustave Caillebotte**. Even though it's set in Paris, not Victorian England, it just clicked for me.

        alt="Test"
      /> </div>



I tweaked the painting a bit, making it look a little disorganized to match the complicated relationship between the main characters. 

My main goal with the design was to capture the tension already in the painting. For the type, I went with Nimbus Sans because it doesn’t have too much personality, which helps not distract the viewer too much from the painting. I chose a cream-yellow color and roughed up the edges to blend it with the background better. The layout is straightforward; I staggered the title and left big spaces to highlight the subjects in the background. 

Overall I think the final cover captured the essence of the book, it looks interesting enough to give you an idea of what the book is going to be about but it also retains some of the mystery that one of the main characters possesses.
